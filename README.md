# Programming - REC 2025
### Problem Statement:
University students often struggle to stay organized and manage their study time effectively across multiple classes, assignments, labs, midterms, appointments, etc. This can lead to missed deadlines, poor academic performance, and burnout.
Your task is to design a minimum viable product (MVP) that helps students efficiently manage their academic life. The tool should be intuitive. There should be a calendar and a dashboard. Users should be able to input tasks at specific dates and times.
